# Minnesota COVID data from the Star Tribune

The Star Tribune has compiled daily data released by the Minnesota Department of Health on the COVID-19 outbreak in Minnesota. The health department generally released updated case information daily at 11 a.m. central time, but the scraper automatically updates these four spreadsheets hourly in case other updates or corrections are made to the site.

#### mn_statewide_timeseries.csv

A statewide daily county of positive COVID-19 tests, compiled by daily scraping of the [Minnesota Department of Health's coronavirus situation page](https://www.health.state.mn.us/diseases/coronavirus/situation.html). Deaths are based on information from the Minnesota Department of Health and Star Tribune reporting.

**UPDATE May 14, 2020:** The Minnesota Department of Health changed its methodology and is now assigning positive tests to the date the specimen was taken, not the date it was reported to MDH. We have updated our data to reflect this change, including past numbers. We have also corrected a double-counting of total tests that MDH was reporting in error from April 25 through May 5.

**UPDATE April 3, 2020:** The Minnesota Department of Health released daily hospitalization numbers on April 3, 2020, in which the data for previous days differed significantly from the numbers they reported on conference calls at the time. The health department reports that the information on the calls was not final and that the data released later should be regarded as more accurate. We have updated our records to reflect these new numbers.

**UPDATE July 3, 2020:** The Minnesota Department of Health will not be updating its situation page on July 4. As a result, our records will not reflect updates on that day. MDH will still collect data for July 4, but will release that data on July 5. Some data may get backdated to July 4, but July 5's data may appear inflated as a result.

**UPDATE Sept. 24, 2020:** The Minnesota Department of Health has stopped reporting the number of patients currently hospitalized and in ICU. They also added two fields to track new hospital and ICU admissions by admission date.
